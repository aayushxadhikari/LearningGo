/* 
Advantages of GO
 1. Code runs fast
 2. Garbage Collection
 3. Simpler Objects
 4. Concurrency is efficient */



// Software Translation 
// Machine Language: CPU instructions represented in binary
// Assembly Language: CPU instructions with mnemonics

// Garbage Collection: 
// 1. Automatic memory management
// - where and when should the memory be managed where and when it should be allocated and deallocated
// 2. Manual memory management is hard
// - Deallocate too early, false memory accesses
// - Deallocate too late, wasted memory


// Object- Oriented Programming 

// - organize your code through encapsulation
// - group together data and functions that are related
// - user-defined type which is specific to an application

// Objects in Go
// -Go doesn't use the term class
// - Go uses structs with associated methods
// - Simplified implementation of classes => no inheritance, constructors, generics

// Concurrency 
// What concurrency solves is the problem that is arising in the parallelism
// - When do tasks start/stop?
// - What if one task needs data from another task?
// - Do tasks conflict in memory?

// So concurrency is the management of multiple tasks in same time.
// (might not be executing at the same time though it might be executing in single-core processor)
// Concurrent programming enable parallelism
// - management of task execution
// - communication between tasks
// - synchronization between tasks

// So what are the things Go is packing for concurrency?
// - Go includes concurrency primitives also are easy and efficient to use.
// - Goroutines represent concurrent tasks
// - Channel are used to communicate between tasks
// - Select enables tasks synchronization

// WorkSpaces:
// Three subdirectories:
// -> src : contains source code files
// -> pkg : contains packages (libraries)
// -> bin : contains executables

// There should always be a main package and the main package should always have the main() function
// main() is where the code execution starts

// fmt => Format package

// Import 
// import keyword is used to access other packages
// Go standard library includes many packages
